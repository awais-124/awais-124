<h1 align="center">Greetings! 👋, I'm Muhammad Awais</h1>
<h3 align="center">Software Engineer</h3>


## About 
<p align="justify">
I'm a <strong>Software Engineer and Data Analyst from Pakistan</strong> with a relentless passion for <em>problem-solving, coding, and continuous self-improvement</em>. My journey in technology is driven by a desire to learn, practice and apply to solve real-world problems.
<br/>
<br/>
Currently pursuing a degree in Computer Science from <strong>Capital University of Science and Technology, Islamabad</strong>, I have developed a solid understanding of Computer Science fundamentals, including <em>Programming, Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), Data Structures and Algorithms, Computer Networks, Operating Systems, Machine Learning, Artificial Intelligence, Data Science and Parallel Programming</em>.
<br/> 
<br/>
My enthusiasm for competitive programming has led me to participate in contests like the <strong>ICPC</strong>, where I’ve honed my problem-solving abilities under pressure. I’m not just about writing code—I’m about crafting solutions. I thrive on challenges that require creativity and precision, and I’m always looking for opportunities to grow my expertise. As I work towards graduation, I'm actively seeking remote roles that allow me to apply my skills in real-world projects while balancing my academic commitments.
<p/>

### 🚀 What I'm Into:
My primary focus lies in the realm of **app development**, **data analysis**, **machine-learning** and **NLP-LLMs**. I have strong grip on JavaScript and React-Native which allows to create intuitive mobile apps. On the other hand, I have hands on experience on working with Python libraries used Machine Learning and Data Sciecne tasks.
